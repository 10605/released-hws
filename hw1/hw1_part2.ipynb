    "Bag-of-words comparisons are not very good when all tokens are treated the same: some tokens are more important than others. Weights give us a way to specify which tokens to favor. With weights, when we compare documents, instead of counting common tokens, we sum up the weights of common tokens. A good heuristic for assigning weights is called \"Term-Frequency/Inverse-Document-Frequency,\" or [TF-IDF][tfidf] for short.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TF\n",
    "\n",
    "TF rewards tokens that appear many times in the same document. It is computed as the frequency of a token in a document, that is, if document *d* contains 100 tokens and token *t* appears in *d* 5 times, then the TF weight of *t* in *d* is *5/100 = 1/20*. The intuition for TF is that if a word occurs often in a document, then it is more important to the meaning of the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "IDF rewards tokens that are rare overall in a dataset. The intuition is that it is more significant if two documents share a rare word than a common one. IDF weight for a token, *t*, in a set of documents, *U*, is computed as follows:\n",
    "* Let *N* be the total number of documents in *U*\n",
    "* Find *n(t)*, the number of documents in *U* that contain *t*\n",
    "* Then *IDF(t) = N/n(t)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that *n(t)/N* is the frequency of *t* in *U*, and *N/n(t)* is the inverse frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note on terminology**: Sometimes token weights depend on the document the token belongs to, that is, the same token may have a different weight when it's found in different documents.  We call these weights *local* weights.  TF is an example of a local weight, because it depends on the length of the source.  On the other hand, some token weights only depend on the token, and are the same everywhere that token is found.  We call these weights *global*, and IDF is one such weight.\n",

    "Now we are ready to do text comparisons in a formal way. The metric of string distance we will use is called **[cosine similarity][cosine]**. We will treat each document as a vector in some high dimensional space. Then, to compare two documents we compute the cosine of the angle between their two document vectors. This is *much* easier than it sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question to answer is how do we represent documents as vectors? The answer is familiar: bag-of-words! We treat each unique token as a dimension, and treat token weights as magnitudes in their respective token dimensions. For example, suppose we use simple counts as weights, and we want to interpret the string \"Hello, world!  Goodbye, world!\" as a vector. Then in the \"hello\" and \"goodbye\" dimensions the vector has value 1, in the \"world\" dimension it has value 2, and it is zero in all other dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next question is: given two vectors how do we find the cosine of the angle between them? Recall the formula for the dot product of two vectors:\n",
    "\\\\[ a \\cdot b = \\| a \\| \\| b \\| \\cos \\theta \\\\]\n",
    "Here \\\\( a \\cdot b = \\sum a_i b_i \\\\) is the ordinary dot product of two vectors, and \\\\( \\|a\\| = \\sqrt{ \\sum a_i^2 } \\\\) is the norm of \\\\( a \\\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can rearrange terms and solve for the cosine to find it is simply the normalized dot product of the vectors. With our vector model, the dot product and norm computations are simple functions of the bag-of-words document representations, so we now have a formal way to compute similarity:\n",
    "\\\\[ similarity = \\cos \\theta = \\frac{a \\cdot b}{\\|a\\| \\|b\\|} = \\frac{\\sum a_i b_i}{\\sqrt{\\sum a_i^2} \\sqrt{\\sum b_i^2}} \\\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "Setting aside the algebra, the geometric interpretation is more intuitive. The angle between two document vectors is small if they share many tokens in common, because they are pointing in roughly the same direction. For that case, the cosine of the angle will be large. Otherwise, if the angle is large (and they have few words in common), the cosine is small. Therefore, cosine similarity scales proportionally with our intuitive sense of similarity.\n",

Our implementation is limited by its quadratic run time complexity, and is not practical for even modestly sized datasets.  In this part, we will implement a more scalable algorithm and use it to do entity resolution on the full dataset.\n",

    "### Inverted Indices\n",
    "To improve our ER algorithm from the earlier parts, we should begin by analyzing its running time. In particular, the algorithm above is quadratic in two ways. First, we did a lot of redundant computation of tokens and weights, since each record was reprocessed every time it was compared. Second, we made quadratically many token comparisons between records.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first source of quadratic overhead can be eliminated with precomputation and look-up tables, but the second source is a little more tricky. In the worst case, every token in every record in one dataset exists in every record in the other dataset, and therefore every token makes a non-zero contribution to the cosine similarity. In this case, token comparison is unavoidably quadratic.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in reality most records have nothing (or very little) in common. Moreover, it is typical for a record in one dataset to have at most one duplicate record in the other dataset (this is the case assuming each dataset has been de-duplicated against itself). In this case, the output is linear in the size of the input and we can hope to achieve linear running time.\n",
    "\n",
    "An [**inverted index**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) is a data structure that will allow us to avoid making quadratically many token comparisons.  It maps each token in the dataset to the list of documents that contain the token.  So, instead of comparing, record by record, each token to every other token to see if they match, we will use inverted indices to *look up* records that match on a particular token.\n",
